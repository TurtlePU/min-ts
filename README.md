# min-TS

Just a demonstration of different kinds of imports in pure HTML + TS stack.

For this to work, you need to download:

1. pixi.min.js -> ```page/js/lib```
2. pixi.js.d.ts -> ```ts/lib```

Then compile TypeScript with ```$ tsc```.

And, finally, start a local site in order to access module-type imports. In Windows, this can be done via IIS.
