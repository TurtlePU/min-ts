# min-TS

Just a demonstration of different kinds of imports in pure HTML + TS stack.

For this to work, you need to download:

1. [pixi.min.js](https://pixijs.download/release/pixi.min.js) -> ```page/js/lib```
2. [pixi.js.d.ts](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-typescript) -> ```ts/lib``` (you need a matching version of ```.d.ts```)

Then compile TypeScript with ```$ tsc```.

And, finally, start a local site in order to access module-type imports. In Windows, this can be done via IIS.
